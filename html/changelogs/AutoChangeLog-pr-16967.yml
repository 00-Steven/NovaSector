changes:
  - rscdel: "Nosha Industries has deleted the blueprints for the old Synth and IPC models, and has replaced them with a single, far more modular design. Precautions have been taken to prevent template corruptions."
  - qol: "Synths are now way more customizable, and no longer have defunct or superfluous options for themselves and other races!"
  - bugfix: "Fixed the IPC Square Synth screen not showing."
  - spellcheck: "Standardized punctuation across all Synth parts."
  - refactor: "Refactored Synths and IPCs into one highly customizable race, just known as \"Synthetic Humanoid\". We've yet to find a better name that's all-encompassing."
  - code_imp: "Added new base classes for single colour and single checkbox prefs for mutant parts."
  - qol: "All races can now customize their hair alpha."
  - qol: "IPC screens now display over their eyes, rather than under."
  - qol: "Synths now have much nicer to look at customization options, and now have icon previews for all their race-specific options!"
  - bugfix: "Fixes a really, really old bug with sprite accessories that could corrupt a player save and make it unusable when a used accessory is removed."
