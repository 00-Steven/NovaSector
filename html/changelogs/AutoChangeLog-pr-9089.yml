  - balance: "If you try using the staff of change, the staff of chaos or the staff of healing as a crewmember, then it'll backfire. The Staff of change wabbajacks the user, like the pool of change; this means you can't become a xenomorph or a syndicate borg. The Staff of chaos has a 5% chance of firing the bolt directly at the user using it. The Staff of healing now behaves like a medibeam gun to non-wizards trying to use it."
