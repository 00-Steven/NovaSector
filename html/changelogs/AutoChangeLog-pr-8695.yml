changes: 
  - bugfix: "Quirks will no longer be in a weird state where they reset and you don't know why anymore. Check your Augments+ tab if that was happening to you, and remove the augments you don't want."
  - bugfix: "The Limbs Augmentations And Markings page was relabeled \"Augments+\" and has been revamped visually to work better."
  - bugfix: "You will no longer wake up on the Interlink with your cybernetics looking wrong because you didn't ensure they were set right properly during your sleep (in the prefs menu)."
  - bugfix: "The breathing tube is now accessible again in the Augments+ tab."
  - bugfix: "The 'Other' gender is now no longer afraid of itself and will now properly render, allowing you to change gender if you'd like."
  - code_imp: "Quirk balance tallying up is now done outside of the TGUI interface, allowing us to hook other systems that cost points into it."
  - refactor: "Refactored the Augmentations panel to actually look decent and support the usage of quirk points to balance stronger or crippling augments."
