changes: 
  - balance: "SOCOM is no longer a machine pistol. It is instead an integrally suppressed semi-automatic. It is now EMP resistant as a trade-off."
  - balance: "Osprey has lost its EMP proofing. Sorry HoP!"
  - tweak: "All PDH handguns now have model names."
  - spellcheck: "Fixed some typos in PDH descriptions, mainly the use of \"pristegious\""
  - spellcheck: "Gave the SOCOM a reference to the game it came from. All PDH pistols now have an assigned \"commonly issued\" part of their descriptions, like Special Ops, Military, Law Enforcement and Corporate."
