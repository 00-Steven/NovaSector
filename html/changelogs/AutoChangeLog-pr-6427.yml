changes: 
  - bugfix: "Stunning a cyborg with a contractor baton now puts your contractor baton on cooldown, just like knocking a human down does. Don't worry, you can still easily chainstun/baton 'n' bash borgs with contractor batons."
  - soundadd: "Attempting to stun a cyborg with a classic baton or a telebaton will play a CLONGing noise, produce a special message, and put your baton on cooldown. Harmbatonning cyborgs with classic batons and telebatons still works, of course."
  - refactor: "The code for classic batons, telebatons, and contractor batons has been doc'd slightly better and refactored a bit."
  - bugfix: "Some edge cases involving cyborgs who somehow both are clumsy and can wield a classic baton have been accounted for. This shouldn't affect normal gameplay unless an admin tries some REALLY weird stuff. Like, clumsy contractor cyborg level weird."
