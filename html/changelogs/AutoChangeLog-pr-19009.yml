changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new version of the conveyor sorter, which allows for more sorters to be placed down as well as sorting in more directions"
  - bugfix: "Both conveyor sorters now inherit the list registered on the device when placing a new sorter you no longer have to place down a sorter then tap it to register a list."
  - bugfix: "Conveyor sorters can no longer be cleaned by wet rags or mops, who would have thought that a device capable of moving objects can be defeated by simple water?"
