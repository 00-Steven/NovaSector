delete-after: True
changes: 
  - rscadd: "All maps now have proper Departmental Guard offices, instead of Security outposts in each department. The computers in said offices have been adjusted where needed.
expansion: Departmental Guards now have lockers that contain two sets of departmental guard gear in their new offices."
  - rscadd: "Departmental Guards now have Departmental Batons."
  - balance: "Departmental Batons work as normal inside their department."
  - balance: "Departmental Batons have three charges for non-departmental uses."
  - balance: "A charge is expended when you baton someone outside of your department."
  - balance: "If all three charges are expended, the baton is unusable until you return to your department and reactivate the baton."
  - balance: "This will reduce the ability of Guards to roll around the station and exert authority where they aren't supposed to be exerting authority."
  - balance: "This will encourage Guards to naturally stay near their department and keep it safe."
  - balance: "The charges system allows Guards to punish people who kite around the edge of their department, while punishing Guards who over-extend too far and should be calling Security."
  - balance: "Departmental Guards have had their cuffs replaced with colored cableties for their department."
  - rscadd: "Departmental Guards are given security HUDs, not HUDglasses, primarily so that they can see job icons and see if someone who ran into their department followed by redshirts is wanted by Security or not, so as to improve communication."
  - balance: "They do not have the access needed to adjust records, however, and will be on read-only mode."
  - rscdel: "All Departmental Guard, Security Officer, HoS, and Warden Stun Batons have been removed from the backpack, and are now in the belts in your security lockers, instead of in your backpack."
  - balance: "This is to keep the number of batons on the map at a consistent level regardless of Security staffing.
qol: Your Security Belt can now be reskinned between Security and Peacekeeper variants."
  - balance: "Brig Officers have had their baton replaced by a Departmental Prison Baton."
  - balance: "Brig Officers have had their taser removed and replaced with a disabler because it's not 2012 anymore and we don't give Security tasers."
  - rscdel: "Security Medics have had their telescopic batons removed, because that's a Head of Staff item and shouldn't be available to rank and file staffers. Telescopic baton creep is a problem and is being slowly addressed."
  - rscdel: "Security Medics have had their firearm removed, as it was an oversight from the original Goofsec PR, and they shouldn't be packing heat like that over other officers."
  - bugfix: "Map icons have been added for the spawn points of all new Skyrat jobs."
  - bugfix: "Spawn points have been added to all maps for Departmental Guards."
  - rscdel: "Security Sergeant has been removed after discussion with policymakers and other developers on the project."
  - rscadd: "An additional Security Officer slot has been opened."
