  - bugfix: "To change the ammo type the detective's revolver can fire you must now use a wrench instead of a screwdriver, removing the need to take out or destroy its firing pin, and you must be holding it to do so."
  - bugfix: "When the detective's revolver misfires from using 357 ammo, the chambered round will actually be spent now."
