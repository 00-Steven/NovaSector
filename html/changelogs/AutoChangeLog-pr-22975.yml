  - rscdel: "Splints are gone. This does mean that medkits now start properly full and not overstuffed by one item, at least."
  - qol: "Gauze is now, once again, usable as a splint. If you're gauzing a limb with both a bleed and a fracture, you prioritize the bleed first."
  - spellcheck: "Gauze that reaches a negative absorption value (making them useless/infective) now tells you that it's ruined."
