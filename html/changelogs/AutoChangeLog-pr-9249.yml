  - balance: "The wine cork fired when champagne is popped open is now a projectile and not a thrown item. It can ricochet on walls and will leave an harmless wine cork item when its trajectory has finished."
  - bugfix: "This also fixes a small exploit with hand-thrown corks knocking people down, which was unintended."
