changes: 
  - bugfix: "Organic bodyparts once again cannot be disabled by reaching maximum damage, and are back to being disabled by compound fracture, burn wound infections, and paralysis."
  - bugfix: "Limbs disabled by compound fractures can be temporarily restored to working order by applying gauze to the limb as a sling."
  - tweak: "Robotic bodyparts can still be disabled by pure damage, as they cannot be wounded."
